- This example shows the procedure of stream reservation via sdn.
  - The network consists of two sinks, a source, an sdn controller, and a switch connecting all other nodes.
  - Source1 acts as the talker within the network and starts advertising its stream 0.1s.
    Sink1 and Sink2 are the listeners and subscribe to Source1's advertised stream.
    After the first listener successfully registers, Source1 starts broadcasting one IEEE8021Q frame per class B interval
