Demonstrates a medium sized TSN network. Traffic generators send Ethernet frames directly.

-  The network contains four hosts (node1, node2, node3, node4) which are connected over
   two TSN, Netconf and Openflow capable switches. The two switches are connected to an SDN controller using an ether switch
   The network period cycle time is 1ms (see omnetpp.ini), used for GateControlLists and Synchronous traffic.
  
-  Node1 starts sending IEEE8021Q traffic with priority 7 once per cylce after 100ms

-  Node2 starts sending IEEE8021Q traffic with priority 7 once per cylce after 200ms

-  Node4 starts sending IEEE8021Q traffic with priority 7 once per cylce after 300ms

-  All nodes except Node3 additionaly send IEEE8021Q traffic with priority 0 every cycle after 300us and 700us

-  Node3 receivs all traffic from Nodes 1, 2 and 4

- Controller is connected to the Switch using the OpenFlow protocol to control the forwarding and the Netconf protocol to manage scheduling and configured flows.

-  A TDMA schedule is enforced for all priority 7 Traffic using the GCLs in the switches either in a static configuration or configured through Netconf.

- There are six basic Configurations posible:
  All configs using netconf can be run with netconf multipart messages which combine multiple netconf operations in one message.
  -  General: The network uses OpenFlow rules to handle the forwarding of traffic
  -  OpenFlow_static_TDMA: The priority 7 flows and schedule are preconfigured at start up for the priority 7 (see flow_table_switch[1, 2].xml, switch[1, 2].ini)
  -  NetConf: Flows and GCL are configured at runtime when new traffic is added using three Netconf applications, one for each traffic source (see netconfappconfig_[1, 2, 3].xml, controller.ini) 
  -  NetConf_Transaction: The standard netconf applications are replaced by transactional applications executing the three configurations as a network wide transaction (see controller.ini)
  -  NetConf_SyncTransaction: The transactions are executed time synchronous at all switches at a calculated worst case time for the transaction to finish
  -  NetConf_SyncTransaction_SoP: The synchronous transactions use the start of a new hyperperiod for the synchronous commit execution
