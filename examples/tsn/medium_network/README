Demonstrates a medium sized TSN network. Traffic generators send Ethernet frames directly.

-  The network contains four hosts (node1, node2, node3, node4) which are connected over
   two TSN, Netconf and Openflow capable switches. The two switches are connected to a sdn controller
   using an ehter switch
   The cycle time 1ms (see omnetpp.ini)
   
-  Node1 starts sending IEEE8021Q traffic with priority 7 once per cylce after 100ms

-  Node2 starts sending IEEE8021Q traffic with priority 7 once per cylce after 200ms

-  Node4 starts sending IEEE8021Q traffic with priority 7 once per cylce after 300ms

-  All nodes except Node3 additionaly send IEEE8021Q traffic with priority 0 every cycle after 300us and 700us

-  Node3 receivs all traffic from Nodes 1, 2 and 4

- Controller is connected to the Switch using the OpenFlow or Netconf protocol to control forwarding and scheduling.


- There are six basic Configurations posible:
  All configs using netconf can be run with netconf multipart messages combining 
  -  General: the network uses simple openflow rules to handle the forwarding of traffic
  -  OpenFlow_static_TDMA: Flows and shedule are staticly preconfigured at start up
  -  NetConf: Flows and GCL are configured at runtime using netconf
  -  NetConf_Transaction: Flows and GCL are configured transactionaly at runtime using netconf
  -  NetConf_SyncTransaction: Flows and GCL are configured transactionaly and time synchronous at runtime using netconf
  -  NetConf_SyncTransaction_SoP: Flows and GCL are configured transactionaly and time synchronous at runtime at the start of a new hyperperiod using netconf
