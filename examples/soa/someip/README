Demonstrates a small SOME/IP Service Discovery network.
After the service discovery publishers send messages to their subscribers.

- The small network contains the three hosts: node1, node2, node3

- Next to that there is one switch that connects every node with each other.
  So all hosts can communicate with each other over the switch.

- node1 provides one publisher service.

- node2 provides one subscriber that subscribes the publisher service on node1.

- node3 provides one publisher service and one subscriber.
  The subscriber on node3 subscribes the publisher service on node3.
