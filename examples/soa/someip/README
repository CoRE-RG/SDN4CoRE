Demonstrates a small SOME/IP Service Discovery network.
After the service discovery publishers send messages to their subscribers.

- The small network contains the three hosts: node1, node2, node3

- 2 switches interconnect the 4 hosts, and an SDN controller manages the network

- node1 has two publisher services (1, 2)
- node2 has two subscriber services (1, 2)
- node3 has 1 subscriber service (1)
- node4 has no publishers or subscribers

- the someip SDN controller app learns available services and forwards offers and subscriptions

- scenario
0. control plane connects to the SDN controller
1. at 1ms the publishers on node1 start first
	- controller learns two publisher services (see controller.controllerState.serviceTable)
	- offers are broadcast in the network on every hop through the controller
2. at 2ms the subscribers on node2 start 
	- controller directly replies to find requests with the learned offers
	- subscription messages are forwarded via the controller towards node1
	- the controller nodes the subscriptions as waiting for acknowledgement
	- subscription acknowledgements are forwarded via the controller towards node 2
	- the controller finalizes the subscription and registers the flows at switch1
3. at 2.125ms (and every 125us) data transmission flows from node1 towards node2 without controller involvement
4. at 10ms the subscriber on node3 starts
	- the find request is directly answered by the controller
	- subscribe is forwarded by the controller through switch1 towards node1 (skipping the switch2-switch1 path)
	- subscribe ack is intercepted by the controller
	- controller configures the flow at both data plane devices
	- subscribeack is forwarded by the controller through switch2 towards node3 (skipping the switch1-switch2 path)
5. at 10.125ms (and every 125us) data flows from node1 towards node2 and node3 without controller involvement
