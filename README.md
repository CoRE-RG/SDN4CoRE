# SDN4CoRE

SDN4CoRE (Software-Defined Networking for Communication over Realtime Ethernet) is an open-source extension for the event-based simulation of programmable (software-defined) real-time Ethernet networks in the [OMNEST/OMNeT++](https://omnetpp.org/) simulation system. It is based on the [INET-Framework](https://inet.omnetpp.org/), providing internet technologies, the [CoRE4INET Framework](https://github.com/CoRE-RG/CoRE4INET), providing real-time Ethernet protocols such as AS6802, AVB and TSN, and the [OpenFlow Framework](https://github.com/CoRE-RG/OpenFlow), originally developed at the University of WÃ¼rzburg, Germany, providing a programmability option via the OpenFlow protocol.
SDN4CoRE provides programmable network devices and controllers for different Ethernet extensions such as IEEE802.1Qbv and AVB (including SRP) and various management protocols such as NetConf and OpenFlow. It was created by the [CoRE (Communication over Realtime Ethernet)](https://core-researchgroup.de/) and the [INET (Internet Technologies)](https://inet.haw-hamburg.de/) research group at the [HAW-Hamburg (Hamburg University of Applied Sciences)](https://www.haw-hamburg.de/english.html).

## IMPORTANT
The SDN4CoRE model is under continuous development: new parts are added, bugs are corrected, and so on. We cannot assert that the implementation will work fully according to the specifications. YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE YOURSELF TO MAKE SURE THAT THE MODELS YOU USE IN YOUR SIMULATIONS WORK CORRECTLY, AND YOU'RE GETTING VALID RESULTS.
